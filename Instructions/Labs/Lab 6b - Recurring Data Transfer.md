    The application ID entered on this form is the client ID of the Azure AD
    Application.

    ![Create recurring data job](Images/Lab6bEx3Task1Step7.png)

   1.  Set up the recurrence as follows: Recurrence pattern: Minutes, repeat
        after/count/1

data job that we created in D365fO.

5.  Now in the main form, Select **Add Job** and create a download job

    Note: The folder is where you want the downloaded files to be placed. It
    should be a new folder, as files will accumulate.

   ![Download folder: \<enter one\> Errors folder: \<enter one\> Data project: CustRecurring Legal entity: USMF Status check interval (sec): 300 ](Images/Lab6bEx3Task2Step5.png)


## Task 3: Set up AAD Parameter in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Apps

4.  Specify User id – your user credentials

Now you would be able to validate that the files that are generated are
downloaded into the local folder.

## Check Output

In the folder, specified in the Recurring Integration Scheduler tool, you will
find the customer’s data is getting exported based on the defined interval.
